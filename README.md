# Electronic Devices

## **Project Overview**

The **Electronic Devices** project is a desktop application built using JavaFX, designed to facilitate the management of various electronic gadgets such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets. This application provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to add devices, view their details in a structured list, and remove unwanted entries. It employs object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like inheritance and encapsulation, showcasing a robust design for modeling diverse device categories.

### **Device Management**
- Effortlessly add new devices to the list with relevant details.
- View all added devices in a dynamically updated display.
- Remove devices with a single click.

  
### **Custom Attributes for Each Device Type**
- **Smartphones**: 
  - Screen dimensions (in inches)
  - Camera megapixel resolution
- **Laptops**:
  - RAM capacity (in GB)
  - Processor details
- **Tablets**:
  - Battery longevity (in hours)
  - Stylus availability (with a toggle option)
    

### **Intuitive User Interface**
- Clear and straightforward navigation, utilizing a **TabPane** for device category selection.
- Input fields with placeholders and validation to guide the user during data entry.

  

### **Running the Application**
1. Open the main entry point of the application (e.g., `Main.java` or `AppLauncher.java`) in your IDE.
2. Execute the application using the IDE's run configuration.
3. Start managing your electronic devices through an elegant and functional interface.
